# CRNS_in_Roaring_Fork_CO
 Python code accompanying the paper, "Network wide Assessment of Soil Moisture Calibration and Biomass Monitoring Using Cosmic ray Neutron Sensing in the Roaring Fork River Basin, Colorado"

## Contents
The repository consists of mock data, data processing and analysis scripts, some helper functions, and mock output data. Two different python environments were used to run the python code, which are given in the requirements1.txt and requirements2.txt files. 

## Files using requirements1.txt:
* BareCountsProcessing.py
* ModCountsProcessing_Des_McJannet.py
     Process neutron data from moderated detector using the Desilets et al. (2010) method 
* ModCountsProcessing_UTS_McJannet.py
* CombineDataWithFunction.py
* CalibrationAnalysisWithKGE.py
## Files using requirements2.txt:
